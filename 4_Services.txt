# Service Broker API
	---> an HTTP interface between the SERVICE MARKETPLACE of a platform and SERVICE BROKERS.

# Service Brokers
	---> Is the component of the SERVICE that implements the SERVICE BROKER API
	---> Responsible for advertising a catalog of service offerings and service plans to the marketplace

	---> two steps are required to make the services available to the end users
	1) Register Broker
		cf create-service-broker <BROKER-NAME> SOMEUSER SOMETHINGSECURE https://mybroker.example.com
	2) Make plans public

	---> List Service Brokers
		* cf service-brokers
	---> Update a Broker
		* cf update-service-broker <BROKER-NAME> SOMEUSER SOMETHINGSECURE https://mybroker.example.com
	---> Rename a Broker
		* cf rename-service-broker <BROKER-NAME> <NEW-BROKER-NAME>
	---> Remove a Broker
		* cf delete-service-broker <BROKER-NAME>
	---> Purge a Service
		= If a service broker has been shut down or removed without first deleting service instances from a CF, 
		  it is unable to remove the service broker or its services and plans from the marketplace
		* cf purge-service-offering service-test
		* cf purge-service-instance <SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME>

# Service Instance
	---> an instantiation of a service offering

# Service Binding
	---> an association between an application and a service instance.

# Managed Services 
	---> DEFINITION = is the practice of OUTSOURCING certain processes and functions intended to improve operations and cut expenses
	---> concept of -> "How to integrate a software service with PCF to create ---> Managed Service and Service Tile for PCF"

# Service Instance Lifecycle & Use
	---> To view a SPECIFIC MARKETPLACE plan detail
		- cf marketplace -s <MARKETPLACE-SERVICE-NAME>
		eg. cf marketplace -s cleardb

	---> To CREATE a SERVICE-INSTANCE
		cf create-service <MARKETPLACE-SERVICE-NAME> <SERVICE-PLAN> <SERVCE-INSTANCE-NAME>
		eg. cf create-service cleardb spark my-cleardb

	---> To check a SERVICE-INSTANCE status
		cf service <SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME>
		eg. cf service my-cleardb ----> return detail info - like status: create succeeded

	---> To UPDATE a service-instance
		cf update-service <SERVICE-INSTANCE> -c '{"PARAMETER": "VALUE"}'
		eg. cf update-service my-cleardb -c '{"count": 3}'
	
		cf service my-cleardb ----> return detail info - like status: update succeeded


# User-Provided Service Instances (UPSI)
	---> enable developers to USE SERVICES that are not available in the marketplace with their apps running on CF
	---> created manually and are not visible in the marketplace
	---> are arbitrary set of key-value pairs

	* CREATE a User-Provided Service Instance
		- cups = create-user-provided-service
		cf cups SERVICE_INSTANCE [-p CREDENTIALS] [-l SYSLOG_DRAIN_URL] [-r ROUTE_SERVICE_URL] [-t TAGS]

		eg. cf cups SERVICE_INSTANCE -p '{"username":"admin", "password":"pa55woRD"}'
		    cf cups SERVICE_INSTANCE -l syslog://example.log-aggregator.com

# Sharing Service Instances
	---> To Share an existing SPRING CLOUD SERVICES service instance
		cf share-service <SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME> [-o ORG-NAME] [-s SPACE-NAME]

	---> Unshare a service instance
		cf unshare-service <SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME> [-o ORG-NAME] [-s SPACE-NAME]

# Space Scoped Brokers
	---> are registered to a specific space, and ALL USERS within that space can automatically access the broker's service plan.
	---> CREATED BY SPACE DEVELOPERS
	---> service visibility is not managed separately.

	= SERVICE-ACCESS
		* cf service-access [-b BROKER] [-e SERVICE] [-o ORG]

			cf enable-service-access [-b BROKER] [-p PLAN] [-o ORG]
		* Disable Service Access
			cf disable-service-access [-b BROKER] [-p PLAN] [-o ORG]

# ROUTE SERVICES
	---> is a kind of marketplace services
	---> sit infront of an app to PROCESS or TRANSOFRM a request before being routed to an app.
	---> are BIND to an app route, NOT with the app
	---> are decoupled from app.

	=> There are 3 MODELS for Route Service
		1 - Fully-Brokered Services
			* Assumption - App's route bind with Route Service
			* Client Request come to the CF Router through Load Balancer, 
     			  CF Router redirect the request to the Route Service Instance (related with => Service Borker), 
			  then Route Service redirect the request back to CF Router through Load Balancer,
			  then the CF Router forward the request to the APP

			* cf create-service BROKER-SERVICE-PLAN SERVICE-INSTANCE
			  cf bind-route-service APP-DOMAIN SERVICE-INSTANCE [--hostname HOSTNAME][--path PATH]

			NOTE:- 	bind-service ---> binds APP with SERVICE-INSTANCE
				bind-route-service ---> binds APP ROUTE with SERVICE-INSTANCE

		2 - Static, Brokered Services
			* an operator installs a static routing service outside of CF --> it could be a piece of hardware, infront of the load balancer
			* the Routing Service runs OUTSIDE of CF
			* Client Request goes directly to the Route Service Instance,
			  then Route Service Intance forward the request to CF Router through Load Balancer,
			  then CF Router pass the request to the APP

		3 - User-provided Services
			* if a Route Service is not listed in the CF marketplace by broker, a developer can bind "local app" as a user-provided service.
			* the steps is the same as Fully-Brokered Services

			* cf cups SERVICE-INSTANCE -r ROUTE-SERVICE-URL or -p '{"URL": "route-service-url"}'
			  cf bind-route-service APP-DOMAIN SERVICE-INSTANCE [--hostname HOSTNAME][--path PATH]
