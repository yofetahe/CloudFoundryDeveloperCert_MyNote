APPLICATION MANAGEMENT
# CF push
	* Push with defalut 
		---> cf push <APP-NAME> 
		---> pushes the app with the default setting - default size of memory and disk space, number of instances, ...
		---> By default, CF sets the HOSTNAME & DOMAIN --> Hostname = app-name(myapp), Domain = cfapps.io ---> https://myapp.cfapps.io

	* Push with Customize Setting 
		= Customize BASIC App Settings - name, instances, memory limit, start command
			---> cf push <APP-NAME> -i 2 -m 512G --no-start

		= Customize the ROUTE - hostname and domain
			---> cf push <APP-NAME> -n calculator -d yamget.com ---> [-n = --hostname]

		= Limit the UPLOAD FILE
			---> by default, CF uploads all app files except version control files and folders with names such as .svn, .git and _darcs
			---> To exclude files from upload ---> create a file [.cfignore] and save it in the directory where 'cf push' command runs

		= Configure App Initialization
			---> To run initialization tasks ---> create a file [.profile] scripts that contains the initialization tasks and save it in the directory where 'cf push' command runs
				eg. the file [.profile] can contain ---> export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 //set the default language for the app

		= Configure App Services
			---> if a NEWLY-PUSHED app has the same NAME & ROUTE as an older app version, 
			     the new app retains the SERVICE BINDINGS and SERVICE CONFIGURATION of the previously-pushed version

	* App Updates and Downtime
		--> When pushing an app that is already RUNNING, CF stops all existing instances of that app. ---> users will get "404 Not Found" message
		--> Possible to avoid app downtime by using the BLUE-GREEN METHOD to swap routes between app versions running in parallel ????

# CF start/stop/restart/restage
	= START
		--> cf push <APP-NAME>
		--> CF determins the START COMMAND for the app from ONE of the THREE
			* the [-c] command-line option in the CF CLI --> cf push <APP-NAME> -c "node APP-NAME.js"
			* the command attribute in the app manifest.yml --> command: node APP-NAME.js
			* the buildpack, w/c provides a start command appropraite for a particular type of app.
		--> cf start <APP-NAME>

		* Forcing CF to use the BUILDPACK START COMMAND
			--> cf push <APP-NAME> -c "null" OR command: null --> in the manifest.yml file
	= RESTART
		--> cf restart APP-NAME
			* stops the app and restart it with the already compiled DROPLET.
			* to refresh the app's ENVIRONMENT after actions such as binding a new service to the app or setting an ENV'T VARIABLE that only the app consume
			*** NOTE *** if the changed ENV'T VARIABLE consumed by buildpack in addition to the app, then the app must be RESTAGE

	= RESTAGE
		--> cf restage APP-NAME
			* stops the app, compile a new droplet (without updating the app source) and start it
# CF delete
	---> To delete an app
	---> cf delete|d <APP-NAME> [-r] [-f] ----> -r = delete any mapped routes, -f = force deletion without confirmation

# CF apps
	---> list all the apps deployed in the space

# Scaling (horizontal/vertical)
	* scaling - two types 
		---> Manual Scaling - is either Horizontal (increasing # instances) or Verital Scaling (increaseing memory or disk space)
			* Horizontal --> cf scale <APP-NAME> -i 5 ---> ensure to handle more user loads or if one of the instance fails, the other will provide service
			* Vertical --> cf scale <APP-NAME> -m 1G -k 512M ---> ensure the app peform better / increase capacity /

		---> Automated Scaling - implemented by using services like Zoo keeper or App Autoscaler Services
			* App Autoscaler - marketplace service that ensures app performance and helps control cost of running apps

# Application manifests
	* Manifest and Command Line options override the default attribute values of 'cf push'
	* Manifest override most recent values, including defaults and values set by commands such as 'cf scale'
	* Command line options override manifests

	* Manifest Format - manifest file written in yaml
		- the file begins with THREE DASHES
		- the 'application:' block begins
		- the 'app name' is preceded by a single dash and once space ---> - name: <APP-NAME>
		- Subseqent lines in the block are indented two spaces to align with name.

	* Deploying MULTIPLE APPs with ONE Manifest file ---> General rule
		- Use a [no-route] line in the description of any app
		- If the manifest file isnot named [manifest.yml] OR not in the current working directory, use the [ -f ] command line option
		- To push a single app rather than all the apps described in the manifest, provide the desired APP-NAME by running ---> cf push <APP-NAME>
